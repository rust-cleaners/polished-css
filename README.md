Build _âœ¨polished_ **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets _([CSS])_ in [Rust]ðŸ¦€ programming language.\
This crate strictly follows **CSS** **W**orking **G**roup _([CSSWG])_ standards/specifications,
and brings type-safety, modularity, and atomicity in the form of an ergonomic syntax,
to create custom styles for front-end applications.

> **Warning**\
> **The project is still development phase**, hence there's a chance for breaking changes in each release.
> In other words, is **not stable yet.**\
> For more information, take a look at [discussion about the Roadmap for version `1.0.0`](https://github.com/rust-cleaners/polished-css/discussions/2).

## Motivation

We weren't satisfied with what currently existed (_at the moment of creating this library)_
in the Rust ecocystem for **using CSS on the frontend apps that is platform or framework agnostic**.\
Most of the solution we're string-based, and that didn't make it any better. In terms of type-safety,
and modularity.

We're hoping to give back to the open-source community for what they have created so far
with amazing open-source solutions which helps with our internal project(s).\
Also, to give it a push to the Rust community, and the ecosystem by bringing more options to table.

Using Star Wars universe as a metaphor:

> The Jedi Master would be - [@vpochapuis](https://github.com/vpochapuis) - who taught his Padawan
> [@xeho91](https://github.com/xeho91) - how to code, and think in Rust. And also use the magic features this programming
> language provides.

_May the force be with them_.

### Name origin

We had a joke about _polish-ing_ things in the code as one of our core member
is PolishðŸª½and the other one is FrenchðŸ¥– with a special sense of humor.
And to go after the name of our Github Organization `rust-cleaners`,
as we were already on the lexical field of maintenance/tindiness,
it was then decided to use `polished` as our crate prefix!
