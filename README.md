# polished-css

Build âœ¨polishedðŸª½ Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in RustðŸ¦€. This crate strictly follows CSSWG standards/specifications and brings type-safety, modularity, and atomicity in the form of an ergonomic syntax to create custom styles for front-end applications.

## Name origin

We had a joke about `polish-ing` things in the code as one of our core member is PolishðŸª½ and the other one is FrenchðŸ¥– with a special sense of humor.
And to go after the name of our Github Organization `rust-cleaners`, as we were already on the lexical field of maintenance/tindiness, it was then decided to use `polished` as our crate prefix!
